<!-- This one of my visualization -->
From this figure, I got that the people who killed by police in USA-State has been decreased on middle of 2017 and it's really good news. The people who killed by police in USA-State in the begining of 2015 until begining of 2017 is more than 60 peoples and it's really quite number.

This is my point for this project, and I have you did much better than me. Then I hope heard some feedback from you, Thank You very much.
